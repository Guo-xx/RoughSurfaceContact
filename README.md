# Rough-surface-contact-area
According to the method provided in an article authored by W. Yan and K. Komvopoulosa, I reproduced the result using Matlab.

Procedure of the code is as following: 

1.Using W-M function to produce artificial 3-D rough surface; 

2.Compute the boundary area a_c_prime; 

3.Compute the contact area S_elastic/S_plastic and contact force F_elastic/F_plastic of different mean surface separation distance 

4.Print contact pressure versus mean surface separation distance and ratio of real contact area versus mean surface separation distance
